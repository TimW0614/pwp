# Milestone 1

## FeedBack

Great job on Milestone 1. The projects directory structure and  HTML is perfect. You only have a very small error in your .git ignore (the I in .idea should be lower case) The epics content is perfect. I can easily picture the fictitious people you created, and  I can imagine how they would be interacting with your site. The only thing you could have gone into a little more detail was the frustrations (which could have been linked more to the goals) Feel free to start working on Milestone 2 whenever you would like.
